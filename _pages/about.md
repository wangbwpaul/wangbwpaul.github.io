<!-- I am a final-year PhD student in English at **Trinity College Dublin** supervised by Prof. Philip Coleman, and currently a visiting doctoral student at **Oxford Centre for Life-Writing**. Before joining Trinity, I obtained my MSc in Literature and Modernity from the **University of Edinburgh** under the supervision of Prof. Randall Stevenson (2017-18). I received my BA in English Language and Literature from **Sun Yat-sen University** (2012-2016) with an exchange year in English/American Studies at the **University of Southern Denmark**. 

My research field is mainly focused on intermedial modernism between literature and visual art, especially poetry and painting. My PhD project is titled **_From_ Ut pictura poesis _to Intermediality: Mina Loy, E. E. Cummings, and Djuna Barnes as Modernist Painter-Poets_** (co-funded by TCD-CSC Joint Scholarship Programme). I have published several articles on Loy’s painterly abstraction, readymade word, and materialist poetics in her ekphrases and avant-garde artworks. Additionally, I presented two papers on Cummings’ visual experiments and Oriental aesthetics on 2021 ALA and 2022 MSA conferences.

Interested in the intermedial collaboration between poetic and non-poetic forms, I organised and chaired a panel **“Intermedial Poetry and Poetics of Intermediality”** on 2022 ISIS conference. I am also contributing a book chapter on the in-betweenness of intermediality to _Palgrave Handbook of Intermediality_, and editing a special issue of _Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics_ on **“Intermedial Poetries: Alternative Methods and Practices”** ([CFP](http://jcla.in/journal-of-comparative-literature-and-aesthetics/call-for-papers/)). This will gather a collection of papers about modern and contemporary poetries in relation to visuality, cinematic lyricism, postdramatic theatre, and digital fashion/video game, etc.

I am an Assistant Professor in English Department at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, receiving my PhD in English Literature from **Trinity College Dublin**, MSc in Literature & Modernity from the **University of Edinburgh**, and BA in English Language & Literature from **Sun Yat-sen University**. Previously, I held visiting studentship and fellowship at Oxford Centre for Life-Writing and Trinity Long Room Hub Arts & Humanities Research Institute. 

My research is located at the intersection of modernist studies and intermedial studies over the twentieth century. I have published papers in these areas for journals such as _Journal of Modern Literature_ (Spring 2025), _Modernist Cultures_ (Fall 2024), _The Modernist Review_, _Orbis Litterarum_, _ANQ_, _The Explicator_, and in edited collections like _American Modernism (Re)Considered_ (Bloomsbury), _Revisiting Modernism_ (Lexington Books), and _The Palgrave Handbook of Intermediality_ (Palgrave Macmillan), etc. I also co-edited a special issue on “Intermedial Poetries: Alternative Methods and Practices” for _Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics_. 

Recently, I am revising a paper titled “Intermedialising Modernities: The Polyphonism of Modernist _Ut picture poesis_,” which reformulates modernist verbal-visual exchanges as dialogic and synergetic. I am also working on another special issue as a follow-up to my organised panel “East-West Transmedial Modernism” at the 3rd International Conference of [Modernist Studies in Asia Network (MSIA)](https://english.hku.hk/events/msia2024/) at the University of Hong Kong this May. Besides, my current book project is based on my doctoral thesis, _[Intermedial Modernism: Mina Loy, E. E. Cummings, and Poet-Painter Artisthood](https://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/104342)_.
