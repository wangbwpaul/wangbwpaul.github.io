<!-- I am a final-year PhD student in English at **Trinity College Dublin** supervised by Prof. Philip Coleman, and currently a visiting doctoral student at **Oxford Centre for Life-Writing**. Before joining Trinity, I obtained my MSc in Literature and Modernity from the **University of Edinburgh** under the supervision of Prof. Randall Stevenson (2017-18). I received my BA in English Language and Literature from **Sun Yat-sen University** (2012-2016) with an exchange year in English/American Studies at the **University of Southern Denmark**. 

My research field is mainly focused on intermedial modernism between literature and visual art, especially poetry and painting. My PhD project is titled **_From_ Ut pictura poesis _to Intermediality: Mina Loy, E. E. Cummings, and Djuna Barnes as Modernist Painter-Poets_** (co-funded by TCD-CSC Joint Scholarship Programme). I have published several articles on Loy’s painterly abstraction, readymade word, and materialist poetics in her ekphrases and avant-garde artworks. Additionally, I presented two papers on Cummings’ visual experiments and Oriental aesthetics on 2021 ALA and 2022 MSA conferences.

Interested in the intermedial collaboration between poetic and non-poetic forms, I organised and chaired a panel **“Intermedial Poetry and Poetics of Intermediality”** on 2022 ISIS conference. I am also contributing a book chapter on the in-betweenness of intermediality to _Palgrave Handbook of Intermediality_, and editing a special issue of _Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics_ on **“Intermedial Poetries: Alternative Methods and Practices”** ([CFP](http://jcla.in/journal-of-comparative-literature-and-aesthetics/call-for-papers/)). This will gather a collection of papers about modern and contemporary poetries in relation to visuality, cinematic lyricism, postdramatic theatre, and digital fashion/video game, etc.

I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in English Department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, receiving my PhD in English Literature from Trinity College Dublin, MSc in Literature & Modernity from the University of Edinburgh, and BA in English Language & Literature from Sun Yat-sen University. Previously, I held visiting studentship and fellowship at Oxford Centre for Life-Writing (Wolfson) and Trinity Long Room Hub Arts & Humanities Research Institute.

My research is located at the intersection of modernist studies and intermedial studies over the twentieth century. Related papers have been published or are forthcoming in these areas for journals such as _Journal of Modern Literature_, _Modernist Cultures_, _Mosaic_, _Papers on Language and Literature_, _NLO_, _Anglia_, _English Studies_, and in edited collections like _Mina Loy in Context_ (Cambridge UP), _American Modernism (Re)Considered_ (Bloomsbury), _The Palgrave Handbook of Intermediality_ (Palgrave Macmillan), etc. I am editing a special issue on “Global Transmedial Modernism” for _[English Language Notes](https://www.colorado.edu/english-language-notes/call-papers)_, and have co-edited another one on “Intermedial Poetries: Alternative Methods and Practices” for _[Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics](https://jcla.in/journal-of-comparative-literature-and-aesthetics/current-issues/)_.

My first monograph _Poet-Painters and Intermedial Modernism: Mina Loy and E. E. Cummings in the Cosmopolitan Avant-Gardes_ will be published by Edinburgh University Press ([Critical Studies in World Literature and Intermediality](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/series-edinburgh-critical-studies-in-world-literature-and-intermediality)). Also, with Prof. Neil Murphy (NTU), I am working on an edited volume titled _Plural Artisthood: Transmedial Reconfigurations since the 20th Century_ ; Dr. Mengchen Lang (SJTU) and I are working on a collection on _Fictionality across Boundaries_.

**Research Interests**: global modernisms; intermediality between literature and art; word and image studies; experimental poetry and poetics; the Euro-American avant-gardes; aesthetic theories from the 20th-century to the contemporary.
