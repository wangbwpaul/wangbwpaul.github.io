[English](https://www.tcd.ie/English/research/current-research-students.php) | [TrinityLRH](https://www.tcd.ie/trinitylongroomhub/research/fellows/2021-22grad-fellows/Bowen-Wang.php) | [IntermedialStudies](http://isis.digitaltextualities.ca/members/bowang/) | [INCH](https://inch.princeton.edu/participants/)

I am currently a PhD student in English at the **Trinity College Dublin** supervised by Prof. Philip Coleman. Before joining Trinity, I obtained my MSc in Literature and Modernity from the **University of Edinburgh** under the supervision of Prof. Randall Stevenson (2017-18). I received my BA in English Language and Literature from **Sun Yat-sen University** (2012-2016) with an exchange year at the **University of Southern Denmark**. 

My research field is mainly focused on intermedial modernism between literature and art, especially poetry and painting. My PhD project is titled **_From_ Ut pictura poesis _to Intermediality: Mina Loy, E. E. Cummings, and Djuna Barnes as Modernist Painter-Poets_** (co-funded by TCD-CSC Joint Scholarship Programme). I published several articles on Loy’s painterly abstraction, readymade word, and materialist poetics in her ekphrases and other avant-garde artworks. Additionally, I presented two papers on Cummings’ visual experiments and Oriental aesthetics on 2021 ALA and 2022 MSA conferences.

Interested in the intermedial collaboration between poetic and non-poetic forms, I organised and chaired a panel **“Intermedial Poetry and Poetics of Intermediality”** on 2022 ISIS conference. I am also contributing a book chapter on the in-betweenness of intermediality to _Palgrave Handbook of Intermediality_, and editing a special issue of _Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics_ on **“Intermedial Poetries: Alternative Methods and Practices”** ([CFP](http://jcla.in/journal-of-comparative-literature-and-aesthetics/call-for-papers/)). This will gather a collection of papers about modern and contemporary poetries in relation to visuality, cinematic lyricism, postdramatic theatre, and digital fashion/video game, etc.
