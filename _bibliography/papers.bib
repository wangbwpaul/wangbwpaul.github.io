  abstract = "From ut pictura poesis to intermediality, the close, interactive, and complicated relationship between poetry and painting has been an inevitable subject under discussion throughout the historiography of literature and fine art. Different approaches and interpretations to/on their sisterhood could come to a broad spectrum of interartistic ideas and practices. William Blake, an English Romantic poet, painter, and printmaker, links word and image by his invention of relief etching, or more understandably, the illuminated painting which juxtaposes his verse with in-text illustrations simultaneously on the same page. His technical strategy has already implied a dynamic and dialectical interrelation between word and image, like the treatment of earlier medieval manuscripts, yet in a more innovative rather than decorative manner. This article, therefore, through a comparative analysis of both Blake’s verbal and visual representations, will first attempt to clarify two distinct modes of combining poetic language with visualisation vis-à-vis form and content, and then critically investigate how this word-image interaction can be used to reflect the poet’s Romantic thought about sociocultural changes and provide new possibilities of reading, interpretation, and aesthetic complexity in that specific epoch.",

  abstract = "Both literary and artistic historiography has been devoted to exploring the basic relationship between the real world and the work of art, from the mimetic theories of Plato and Aristotle to the contemporary theorists, i.e. Nelson Goodman and Ernst H. Gombrich. Their a�empts to probe into the nature of pictorial representation mainly respond to two questions: What is the relationship between representation and that it is to represent (between picture and reality)? What is the mechanism of, or in an ontological sense, what is representation? Guided by these two questions, my article will critically investigate the models of Goodman’s and Gombrich’s representation theory on account of convention rather than resemblance, expression, or imitation.",

  abstract = "Grounded on the recognizably formalist revolution of language and poetic word, Mina Loy never tends toward a minimalist or primitivist treatment of representation. Instead, she strives for a self-sufficient, autonomous abstract form. To be abstract is to realize a conceptually and materially dynamic network of creating, observing, and reflecting between the artisthood and the spectatorship. Thus, as seen in Loy’s painterly and sculptural ekphrases of Constantin Brancusi’s and Wyndham Lewis’ works, this interart possibility of constructivist abstraction allows the poet not just to create an abstract form considered in its pure essence. More radically, Loy is able to capture the constructive process in between, inspired by those avant-garde experimentations, by recasting the conventional form and material to imagine alternative expressions and modes of identity.",

  abstract = "Between 1919 and 1930, Mina Loy created a series of pictorial and poetic portraits of her artistic contemporaries: from pen-ink sketches such as Constantin Brancusi, Carl Van Vechten, Jules Pascin, Marianne Moore, to linguistically innovative verses like “‘Joyce’s Ulysses,” “Gertrude Stein,” “Nancy Cunard,” and a note “William Carlos Williams.” In interacting with avant-gardists of her time, Loy explored new patterns of expression as an alternative to literary and cultural conventions. This paper will thus investigate the use of readymade words in two of Loy’s artist-portrait poems depicting Gertrude Stein and James Joyce. Her verbal portraits do not merely offer the reader a poetic profile of modernist artists and their formal experimentation. It will be demonstrated at the end of this paper that, by treating the word as readymade, Loy and her portrayed writers are able to articulate a different form of language that is more fluid, plastic, and performative.",
