  abstract="Bowen Wang interviewed Randall Stevenson on the evolving state of modernist literature and its far-reaching legacies across the twentieth century. Stevenson articulates modernism not merely as an experimental movement but as a sustained interrogation of sociocultural values of its historical moment. The conversation covers a broad spectrum of thematic and critical concerns, including modernism’s dialectical relation with modernity, war representations, gendered narratives, its intersection with new media, and the liminal position within the “intermodernist” transition from late modernism to postmodernism. Through this discussion, the interview reveals the complexities of modernism as both aesthetic and epistemological paradigm, and foregrounds its enduring significance in shaping the trajectory of twentieth-century English literature. It ultimately elicits a reconsideration of modernism’s iterative dialogues with contemporary artistic, historical, and cultural formations"

  abstract="Among his intermedial enterprises, E. E. Cummings engaged with the genre of still life. Instead of displaying inanimate matters in a traditional manner, the poet-painter transfigured the physically motionless façade of everyday objects into a dynamic and visceral experience of (self-)vitalizing. His aesthetic representation of the quotidian conflates the material and the immaterial as a modernist craft of art-making that recreates a vibrating entanglement of the thingy form, its surroundings, and one's attentive and meditative continuum. Through his verbal-visual experiments, Cummings overrides the distinction between the static and the motile, interiority and exteriority, and art and life, by foregrounding the intrinsic spirit of still life as an evolving desire to be encoded and reconfigured in varying senses and structures. His visceral poetics of reinstating liveness/liveliness from stillness thus provides the reader-viewers with an active way of dialoguing with the corporeal, affective, and imaginary realities that surround them."

  abstract="In the context of intermedial modernism, this article delves into the Fauvist and Cubist influences of Continental avant-gardes and their painterly crafts on E. E. Cummings’ early poems from the 1920s. During this ‘Francophile’ period in Paris encountering Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, Cummings has cultivated a distinct modernist vision that transcends the national, cultural and medium-specific boundaries. His artistic experimentation entails the bold use of wild colours, abstract lines, analytic forms and typographical language. The core of this composite artistry resides in the prosodic intermediality as eccentric craftsmanship exhibited in his ‘poempictures.’ The poet-painter dedicated himself to a creative transfiguration of linguistic structures and graphic patterns, melding them into alternative modes of expression that reshape our perceptions, affections and multisensual experiences. In doing so, Cummings’ intermedial prosody envisions an idiosyncratically avant-garde palette to celebrate the vitality, dynamism and self-transcendence intrinsic to the pluralistic ethos of modernist aesthetics."

  abstract="The early twentieth century ushered in an unprecedented era of intermedial convergence, where different art forms such as poesis and pictura began to confabulate with each other rather than competing in historically paragonal debates. A hallmark of modernist aesthetics is the shift towards the non-verbal mediums, with poets breaking away from outdated subjects and linguistic structures, and instead experimenting with the visual, material, and spatial incorporation from non-literary domains. Hence, this article proposes an alternative framework for understanding and reconceptualising modernism through intermediality. It develops the polyphonically dialogic poetics—based on four types of dialogues: referential, associative, programmatic, and self-reflexive—emphasising the interaction and re-unification between textuality and visuality. Concluding with this typology of modernist collaborations, the study illuminates the mutual agency of creators of the time and the sociocultural implications of their artefacts. By adopting a revisionary focus on intermediality as an act of dialogising, it critically reinterprets the mediation within modernist ut pictura poesis as fluid, multifarious, and synergetic."

  abstract="Tom Stoppard's The Invention of Love (1997) offers the audience a dream-like voyage through the post-mortem reminiscences of the central character, A. E. Housman. The attempt to resurrect Housman, as the historical figure in real life, is suspended by the intertextual incorporation of Housman's poems, the both fictive and enigmatically private voice of which opens up the illusory closure of biographically accurate dramatic characterisation. By fluidising and activating the subversive emotions contained in the formal patterns of the poetic text, the intermedial stage with the corporeality of its theatrical embodiment becomes a spatialised metaphor for the poetry as an open space that is inviting meaning to be projected onto it. The poetic and the theatrical, thus deterritorialised by their intermedial exchanges, interlace a dreamscape in which the nomadic search for the uncorrupted, unappropriated poet/poem continuum provides a transcendental empiricist reading of the ‘truth’ about Housman.",

  abstract = "From ut pictura poesis to intermediality, the close, interactive, and complicated relationship between poetry and painting has been an inevitable subject under discussion throughout the historiography of literature and fine art. Different approaches and interpretations to/on their sisterhood could come to a broad spectrum of interartistic ideas and practices. William Blake, an English Romantic poet, painter, and printmaker, links word and image by his invention of relief etching, or more understandably, the illuminated painting which juxtaposes his verse with in-text illustrations simultaneously on the same page. His technical strategy has already implied a dynamic and dialectical interrelation between word and image, like the treatment of earlier medieval manuscripts, yet in a more innovative rather than decorative manner. This article, therefore, through a comparative analysis of both Blake’s verbal and visual representations, will first attempt to clarify two distinct modes of combining poetic language with visualisation vis-à-vis form and content, and then critically investigate how this word-image interaction can be used to reflect the poet’s Romantic thought about sociocultural changes and provide new possibilities of reading, interpretation, and aesthetic complexity in that specific epoch.",

Their attempts to probe into the nature of pictorial representation mainly respond to two questions: What is the relationship between representation and that it is to represent (between picture and reality)? What is the mechanism of, or in an ontological sense, what is representation? Guided by these two questions, my article will critically investigate the models of Goodman’s and Gombrich’s representation theory on account of convention rather than resemblance, expression, or imitation.",

This paper will thus investigate the use of readymade words in two of Loy’s artist-portrait poems depicting Gertrude Stein and James Joyce. Her verbal portraits do not merely offer the reader a poetic profile of modernist artists and their formal experimentation. It will be demonstrated at the end of this paper that, by treating the word as readymade, Loy and her portrayed writers are able to articulate a different form of language that is more fluid, plastic, and performative.",

To discover how this materialisation of language explored the interplay of literary and artistic modernism, this paper will critically scrutinise Mina Loy’s and James Joyce’s radical reforms of writing and try to answer the following questions: how did Loy’s multifarious artisthood and poem-writing exchange, interact with, and reinforce each other? As both were closely associated with avant-garde art movements between Europe and America, how did Joyce influence Loy’s refashioning of “torrential languages” (LoLB 88) as a creative model of linguistic experimentation? How did their visual aesthetics and experimental poetics help to declare the independence of language and the shape of aesthetic modernism in a new historical epoch?",

As a metafictional novel, it deploys one of the critical postmodernist textual strategies to establish the sense of literary hyperreality.

By doing so, it will then critically analyze the establishment of – in Jean Baudrillard’s notion – textual hyperreality, through which structuralist meaning and interpretation have been disrupted and reconstructed in a postmodernist epistemology to realize a new and negotiating relationship between the text, the reader, and the living world.",
