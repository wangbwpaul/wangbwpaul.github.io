  abstract="E. E. Cummings, a poet-painter from the twentieth-century American Parnassus, marks the dynamic exchange of multiple modalities that revitalize the cross-fertilization of modernist poetry and visual art. Especially noteworthy is his experimental approach to graphic writing, an innovative artistry that he coins “poempictures”. This chapter explores Cummings’ transmedial prowess of using color/line and letter/space, highlighting how he meticulously weaves together verbal-visual fractures to crisscross traditional artistic boundaries. By examining his unconventional techniques for transforming or synthesizing these mediums, the chapter invites a reevaluation of Cummings’ idiosyncratic acrobatics that grapple with the elements of materiality, experimental essence, and tangible concreteness in his poetic modernism. Furthermore, it sheds light on the dialectical relationship that exists between word and image, the temporal and the spatial, allowing the reader-viewer to contemplate the revolutionary potential of his composite artforms in that specific epoch. Ultimately, Cummings’ transmedial poetics of “poempicturality” serves as a testament to his modernist quest for freedom, individuality, and self-expression in response to the mechanization and alienation of the postwar modernity.",

  abstract="The Horatian dogma of ut pictura poesis positions itself at the interdisciplinary confluence not only of poetry and painting, but also, to a large extent, of rhetoric and aesthetics, epistemology and philosophy, cognition and other related social sciences. The theoretical discussion on the relationship of different media first emerged as a structural parallel that stressed kinship and harmony in Aristotelian poetics, and was then transformed into paragonal debates that emphasized difference and exceptionality during the Renaissance. Later, it arrived at an extreme delimitation of temporal and spatial arts, which deepened the historically empirical concern regarding philosophical and aesthetic fundamentals in the implications of binary opposition. Therefore, to sidestep the formal comparativity or time/space dichotomy as delineated from a genealogical approach, the notion of intermediality should be reformulated as a conceptual and ideological extension of ut pictura poesis. Its intermedial core shall be better understood on a theoretical basis of in-betweenness underpinned by a poststructuralist tendency. These both provide alternatives to the universality, radicalism, grand narrative, and fixed identity championed in the traditional literary and other art forms. Coming from the position of the in-between, intermediality has offered a series of new perspectives that transcend a limited point of view, cross the boundaries of stereotyped sections, decenter long-established authorities, link disconnected fragments, and search for revolutionary potentials. At the ultimate end, it creates a dynamic, fluid, and highly interactive communication that was scarce in the preexisting literary and art historiography.",

  abstract = "Ezra Pound, a modernist experimentalist, executed his motto “make it new” by enriching poetry with inspiration from modern paintings. Bridging the realms of art history and literature, a practice of intermediality, he fulfilled his innovative promises and managed to establish a unique voice in early twentieth-century Parnassus. To some extent, he could be entitled as the central figure of the avant-gardist art movements, from London, Paris, to Rome, who worked as – in Wyndham Lewis’ word – a vortex in the whirlpool of Post-Impressionism, Imagism, Futurism, Cubism, and Vorticism, to consistently exercise and perfect his notion of primary pigment. The newly-emerging modernism, following the post-romantic fusion of different types of art, is concerned with an alternative frame, transcending the generic and formal boundaries assigned by the neoclassical aesthetic theory in the previous century to advance beyond the limitations of each medium. As an alternative to the constructivist aesthetics, Pound’s experimental poetics resorts to a complex, balanced network of the featured thematic or formal dimensions of poetry and visual art. The limitation of language, the crisis of representation, and the interdisciplinarity of aestheticism that influenced Pound and his poetics of beauty in the early years, thus render him conscious of the need of searching for a new vocabulary by translating the verbal into the visual. In this sense, Pound’s establishment of Imagism and then involvement in Vorticism in the post-impressionist context has shown his continuous efforts to separate from realist, naturalist conventions and create new forms and radical voices of the modernist aesthetics.",
