  abstract = "Ezra Pound, a modernist experimentalist, executed his motto “make it new” by enriching poetry with inspiration from modern paintings. Bridging the realms of art history and literature, a practice of intermediality, he fulfilled his innovative promises and managed to establish a unique voice in early twentieth-century Parnassus. To some extent, he could be entitled as the central figure of the avant-gardist art movements, from London, Paris, to Rome, who worked as – in Wyndham Lewis’ word – a vortex in the whirlpool of Post-Impressionism, Imagism, Futurism, Cubism, and Vorticism, to consistently exercise and perfect his notion of primary pigment. The newly-emerging modernism, following the post-romantic fusion of different types of art, is concerned with an alternative frame, transcending the generic and formal boundaries assigned by the neoclassical aesthetic theory in the previous century to advance beyond the limitations of each medium. As an alternative to the constructivist aesthetics, Pound’s experimental poetics resorts to a complex, balanced network of the featured thematic or formal dimensions of poetry and visual art. The limitation of language, the crisis of representation, and the interdisciplinarity of aestheticism that influenced Pound and his poetics of beauty in the early years, thus render him conscious of the need of searching for a new vocabulary by translating the verbal into the visual. In this sense, Pound’s establishment of Imagism and then involvement in Vorticism in the post-impressionist context has shown his continuous efforts to separate from realist, naturalist conventions and create new forms and radical voices of the modernist aesthetics.",
