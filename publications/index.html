The conversation covers a broad spectrum of thematic and critical concerns, including modernism‚Äôs dialectical relation with modernity, war representations, gendered narratives, its intersection with new media, and the liminal position within the ‚Äúintermodernist‚Äù transition from late modernism to postmodernism. Through this discussion, the interview reveals the complexities of modernism as both aesthetic and epistemological paradigm, and foregrounds its enduring significance in shaping the trajectory of twentieth-century English literature.

E. Cummings engaged with the genre of still life. Instead of displaying inanimate matters in a traditional manner, the poet-painter transfigured the physically motionless fa√ßade of everyday objects into a dynamic and visceral experience of (self-)vitalizing. His aesthetic representation of the quotidian conflates the material and the immaterial as a modernist craft of art-making that recreates a vibrating entanglement of the thingy form, its surroundings, and one‚Äôs attentive and meditative continuum. Through his verbal-visual experiments, Cummings overrides the distinction between the static and the motile, interiority and exteriority, and art and life, by foregrounding the intrinsic spirit of still life as an evolving desire to be encoded and reconfigured in varying senses and structures. His visceral poetics of reinstating liveness/liveliness from stillness thus provides the reader-viewers with an active way of dialoguing with the corporeal, affective, and imaginary realities that surround them.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JCLA</abbr></div> <div id="wang2024introduction" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Introduction: Towards an Alternative Poetics of Intermediality</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em>,¬†and¬†Amelia McConville</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Intermedial Poetries: Alternative Methods and Practices, special issue of Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics, vol. 47, no. 2, 2024, pp. 1-7.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787043693&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=02528169&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E3cf1cb9b&amp;aty=open-web-entry" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">MC</abbr></div> <div id="wang2024draughtsman" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">"A draughtsman of words": The Modernist Crafting of Prosodic Intermediality in E.

E. Cummings‚Äô early poems from the 1920s. During this ‚ÄòFrancophile‚Äô period in Paris encountering Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, Cummings has cultivated a distinct modernist vision that transcends the national, cultural and medium-specific boundaries. His artistic experimentation entails the bold use of wild colours, abstract lines, analytic forms and typographical language. The core of this composite artistry resides in the prosodic intermediality as eccentric craftsmanship exhibited in his ‚Äòpoempictures.‚Äô The poet-painter dedicated himself to a creative transfiguration of linguistic structures and graphic patterns, melding them into alternative modes of expression that reshape our perceptions, affections and multisensual experiences. In doing so, Cummings‚Äô intermedial prosody envisions an idiosyncratically avant-garde palette to celebrate the vitality, dynamism and self-transcendence intrinsic to the pluralistic ethos of modernist aesthetics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JLS</abbr></div> <div id="wang2024intermedialisngmodernities" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Intermedialising Modernities: The Polyphonism of Modernist Ut pictura poesis</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Literary Studies, vol. 40, 2024, pp. 1-20.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://unisapressjournals.co.za/index.php/jls/article/view/16262" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The early twentieth century ushered in an unprecedented era of intermedial convergence, where different art forms such as poesis and pictura began to confabulate with each other rather than competing in historically paragonal debates. A hallmark of modernist aesthetics is the shift towards the non-verbal mediums, with poets breaking away from outdated subjects and linguistic structures, and instead experimenting with the visual, material, and spatial incorporation from non-literary domains. Hence, this article proposes an alternative framework for understanding and reconceptualising modernism through intermediality. It develops the polyphonically dialogic poetics‚Äîbased on four types of dialogues: referential, associative, programmatic, and self-reflexive‚Äîemphasising the interaction and re-unification between textuality and visuality. Concluding with this typology of modernist collaborations, the study illuminates the mutual agency of creators of the time and the sociocultural implications of their artefacts. By adopting a revisionary focus on intermediality as an act of dialogising, it critically reinterprets the mediation within modernist ut pictura poesis as fluid, multifarious, and synergetic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ANQ</abbr></div> <div id="wang2024austere" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">‚ÄúIn the austere theatre of the Infinite‚Äù: Constructivist Abstraction as the Aesthetic Archetype in Mina Loy‚Äôs Ekphrases</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews, vol. 37, no. 1, 2024, pp. 70-77.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0895769X.2022.2064807" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">OL</abbr></div> <div id="yang2024poet" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Poet as Poem: The Intermedial Staging of A.

The attempt to resurrect Housman, as the historical figure in real life, is suspended by the intertextual incorporation of Housman‚Äôs poems, the both fictive and enigmatically private voice of which opens up the illusory closure of biographically accurate dramatic characterisation. By fluidising and activating the subversive emotions contained in the formal patterns of the poetic text, the intermedial stage with the corporeality of its theatrical embodiment becomes a spatialised metaphor for the poetry as an open space that is inviting meaning to be projected onto it. The poetic and the theatrical, thus deterritorialised by their intermedial exchanges, interlace a dreamscape in which the nomadic search for the uncorrupted, unappropriated poet/poem continuum provides a transcendental empiricist reading of the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô about Housman.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Explicator</abbr></div> <div id="wang2022words" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Words as Readymade: Mina Loy‚Äôs Verbal Portraiture of ‚ÄúGertrude Stein‚Äù and ‚ÄúJoyce‚Äôs Ulysses‚Äù</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The Explicator, vol. 80, no. 1-2, 2022, pp. 53-59.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00144940.2022.2080522" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Between 1919 and 1930, Mina Loy created a series of pictorial and poetic portraits of her artistic contemporaries: from pen-ink sketches such as Constantin Brancusi, Carl Van Vechten, Jules Pascin, Marianne Moore, to linguistically innovative verses like ‚Äú‚ÄòJoyce‚Äôs Ulysses,‚Äù ‚ÄúGertrude Stein,‚Äù ‚ÄúNancy Cunard,‚Äù and a note ‚ÄúWilliam Carlos Williams.‚Äù In interacting with avant-gardists of her time, Loy explored new patterns of expression as an alternative to literary and cultural conventions.

As a metafictional novel, it deploys one of the critical postmodernist textual strategies to establish the sense of literary hyperreality.

To investigate the self-conscious, self-reflexive characteristics in Amis‚Äôs novel, this article will focus on authorial intrusion, doubling, metafictional commentary/criticism, and text-reader interaction. By doing so, it will then critically analyze the establishment of ‚Äì in Jean Baudrillard‚Äôs notion ‚Äì textual hyperreality, through which structuralist meaning and interpretation have been disrupted and reconstructed in a postmodernist epistemology to realize a new and negotiating relationship between the text, the reader, and the living world.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JLAS</abbr></div> <div id="wang2021word" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Word-Image Intertwining: William Blake‚Äôs Illuminated Poetry and the Aesthetics of Compositeness</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Literature and Art Studies, vol. 11, no. 6, 2021, pp. 375-87.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.davidpublisher.com/index.php/Home/Article/index?id=45844.html" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>From ut pictura poesis to intermediality, the close, interactive, and complicated relationship between poetry and painting has been an inevitable subject under discussion throughout the historiography of literature and fine art. Different approaches and interpretations to/on their sisterhood could come to a broad spectrum of interartistic ideas and practices. William Blake, an English Romantic poet, painter, and printmaker, links word and image by his invention of relief etching, or more understandably, the illuminated painting which juxtaposes his verse with in-text illustrations simultaneously on the same page. His technical strategy has already implied a dynamic and dialectical interrelation between word and image, like the treatment of earlier medieval manuscripts, yet in a more innovative rather than decorative manner. This article, therefore, through a comparative analysis of both Blake‚Äôs verbal and visual representations, will first attempt to clarify two distinct modes of combining poetic language with visualisation vis-√†-vis form and content, and then critically investigate how this word-image interaction can be used to reflect the poet‚Äôs Romantic thought about sociocultural changes and provide new possibilities of reading, interpretation, and aesthetic complexity in that specific epoch.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JCLA</abbr></div> <div id="wang2020demystification" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Demystification of the ‚ÄúInnocent Eye‚Äù: Nelson Goodman, Ernst H.

Modernism, rather than being confined to regional or national categories, is characterized by its transcontinental, interdisciplinary agencies with different languages, cultures, and mediums intertwining. Far from being a Western-centric movement, modernism absorbed influences from around the globe, notably East Asia, where Japanese haikus, Chinese ideograms, and other artistic mediums took pivotal roles in reshaping avant-garde practices. This East-West dynamic has generated a transmedially-oriented aesthetic of formal spontaneousness, expressive essence, and spatial complexity that disrupts established conventions and redefines modernist poetics as cross-cultural and international. Recent scholarship by Zhaoming Qian, Ming Dong Gu, Yunte Huang, Steven Yao, and Christopher Bush, among others, has investigated the cosmopolitan interactions in the modernist era. Central to this special issue is the notion of transmediality‚Äîthe confluence of literature with other artforms such as photography, music, visual art, cinema, and theatre‚Äîacross the Pacific Rim. By exploring how Western and East-Asian traditions and innovations interacted with each other, the issue aims to unravel the collaborative energies that moved beyond colonialist or orientalist assumptions. What resulted was a broad spectrum of verbivocovisual experiments that opened new paths in reconsidering global modernisms/modernities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JCLA</abbr></div> <div id="wang2024introduction" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Intermedial Poetries: Alternative Methods and Practices</div> <div class="author"> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics, vol. 47, no. 2, 2024, 185 pages</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787043693&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=02528169&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E3cf1cb9b&amp;aty=open-web-entry" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h1>Book Chapters</h1> <h2 class="year">2025</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">BA</abbr></div> <div id="wang2025theimageof" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">"The image of one fatal word": Transmedial Crisscrossings in E.

E.

Especially noteworthy is his experimental approach to graphic writing, an innovative artistry that he coins ‚Äúpoempictures‚Äù. This chapter explores Cummings‚Äô transmedial prowess of using color/line and letter/space, highlighting how he meticulously weaves together verbal-visual fractures to crisscross traditional artistic boundaries. By examining his unconventional techniques for transforming or synthesizing these mediums, the chapter invites a reevaluation of Cummings‚Äô idiosyncratic acrobatics that grapple with the elements of materiality, experimental essence, and tangible concreteness in his poetic modernism. Furthermore, it sheds light on the dialectical relationship that exists between word and image, the temporal and the spatial, allowing the reader-viewer to contemplate the revolutionary potential of his composite artforms in that specific epoch. Ultimately, Cummings‚Äô transmedial poetics of ‚Äúpoempicturality‚Äù serves as a testament to his modernist quest for freedom, individuality, and self-expression in response to the mechanization and alienation of the postwar modernity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PM</abbr></div> <div id="wang2023reformulating" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Reformulating the Theory of Literary Intermediality: A Genealogy from Ut Pictura Poesis to Poststructuralist In-Betweenness</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The Palgrave Handbook of Intermediality, edited by J√∏rgen Bruhn et al., Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2023, pp. 339-64.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-031-28322-2_5" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The Horatian dogma of ut pictura poesis positions itself at the interdisciplinary confluence not only of poetry and painting, but also, to a large extent, of rhetoric and aesthetics, epistemology and philosophy, cognition and other related social sciences. The theoretical discussion on the relationship of different media first emerged as a structural parallel that stressed kinship and harmony in Aristotelian poetics, and was then transformed into paragonal debates that emphasized difference and exceptionality during the Renaissance. Later, it arrived at an extreme delimitation of temporal and spatial arts, which deepened the historically empirical concern regarding philosophical and aesthetic fundamentals in the implications of binary opposition. Therefore, to sidestep the formal comparativity or time/space dichotomy as delineated from a genealogical approach, the notion of intermediality should be reformulated as a conceptual and ideological extension of ut pictura poesis. Its intermedial core shall be better understood on a theoretical basis of in-betweenness underpinned by a poststructuralist tendency. These both provide alternatives to the universality, radicalism, grand narrative, and fixed identity championed in the traditional literary and other art forms. Coming from the position of the in-between, intermediality has offered a series of new perspectives that transcend a limited point of view, cross the boundaries of stereotyped sections, decenter long-established authorities, link disconnected fragments, and search for revolutionary potentials. At the ultimate end, it creates a dynamic, fluid, and highly interactive communication that was scarce in the preexisting literary and art historiography.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">LCIR</abbr></div> <div id="wang2021wInterdisciplinaryDiscourses" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">‚ÄúSave this damn‚Äôd profession of writing‚Äù: Ezra Pound‚Äôs Images, Vortex, and Poetics of Intermediality</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Music, Poetry and Language: Sound, Sight and Speech in Comparative and Creative Connection, edited by Konrad Gunesch, London: Interdisciplinary Discourses, 2021, pp. 249-262.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.lcir.co.uk/product/music-poetry-and-language-sound-sight-and-speech-in-comparative-and-creative-connection-ebook/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Ezra Pound, a modernist experimentalist, executed his motto ‚Äúmake it new‚Äù by enriching poetry with inspiration from modern paintings. Bridging the realms of art history and literature, a practice of intermediality, he fulfilled his innovative promises and managed to establish a unique voice in early twentieth-century Parnassus. To some extent, he could be entitled as the central figure of the avant-gardist art movements, from London, Paris, to Rome, who worked as ‚Äì in Wyndham Lewis‚Äô word ‚Äì a vortex in the whirlpool of Post-Impressionism, Imagism, Futurism, Cubism, and Vorticism, to consistently exercise and perfect his notion of primary pigment. The newly-emerging modernism, following the post-romantic fusion of different types of art, is concerned with an alternative frame, transcending the generic and formal boundaries assigned by the neoclassical aesthetic theory in the previous century to advance beyond the limitations of each medium. As an alternative to the constructivist aesthetics, Pound‚Äôs experimental poetics resorts to a complex, balanced network of the featured thematic or formal dimensions of poetry and visual art. The limitation of language, the crisis of representation, and the interdisciplinarity of aestheticism that influenced Pound and his poetics of beauty in the early years, thus render him conscious of the need of searching for a new vocabulary by translating the verbal into the visual. In this sense, Pound‚Äôs establishment of Imagism and then involvement in Vorticism in the post-impressionist context has shown his continuous efforts to separate from realist, naturalist conventions and create new forms and radical voices of the modernist aesthetics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h1>Other Articles</h1> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">TMR</abbr></div> <div id="wang2022logopoeia" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mina Loy, Logopoeia, and The Alphabet that Builds Itself</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The Modernist Review, issue 39, 4 April 2022.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://modernistreviewcouk.wordpress.com/2022/04/04/mina-loy-logopoeia-and-the-alphabet-that-builds-itself/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">USSO</abbr></div> <div id="wang2020decomposing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Decomposing and Reconstructing the Marginal: Walker Evans‚Äô Portrait Photography in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</div> <div class="author"> <em>Bowen Wang</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>U.S. Studies Online: Forum for New Writing, 5 October 2020.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://usso.uk/decomposing-and-reconstructing-the-marginal-walker-evans-portrait-photography-in-let-us-now-praise-famous-men/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> ¬© Copyright 2025 Bowen Wang.
